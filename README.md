# Numerical-analysis---Linear-system-and-Matrix-decomposition

Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation for the problems of mathematical analysis .
In this repository you will find numerical analysis algorithms for solving linear equation systems and matrix decomposition. These will use the Cholesky, lower upper and Gaussian elimination methods.
For the algorithms, the book by Burden & Faires was used.
